<ol>
<li><p>Usage of the Website for regular Account Users is completely voluntary.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating an Account on the Website is free of charge and carries no financial obligations. Above point notwithstanding, there is a possibility of purchasing a subscription allowing one to place more Queries every day and use more functions of the Website.</p></li>
<li><p>The Administrator takes utmost care to provide their services via the Website in a fully satisfactory manner to the Users.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to fully utilise the Website&#39;s capabilities, one should familiarise themselves with and accept the contents of the Regulations.</p></li>
<li><p>Users are registered on the Website via its webpage containing a Registration Form, by filling it with their data (e-mail address), creating a password protecting the Account, and clicking the button confirming the registration, having first accepted these Regulations.</p></li>
<li><p>The contract between the Account User and the Administrator is concluded for an indefinite period.</p></li>
<li><p>The Service Contract is considered concluded once the User presses (clicks) the button confirming their registration on the Website.</p></li>
<li><p>The Administrator has the right to terminate the Contract concluded with the User with a notice period of 14 days. The termination shall be communicated to the User via e-mail sent to the e-mail address provided during registration.</p></li>
<li><p>The User may withdraw from the Contract concluded with the Administrator at any time by sending a message informing of their intent to do so to the address: Pl.

</ol>

<h5>§4. FUNCTIONALITY OF THE WEBSITE</h5>

<ol>
<li><p>The basic functionality of the Website consists in placing Queries for analysis of attributes of websites appearing in organic Google searches and analysing their common dependencies, by any selected phrase, in specified location and language.</p></li>
<li><p>The analysis results are presented in a graphical format – as charts, reports, lists, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of analyses, as well as a catalogue of available factors, are available in the demo version of the platform at https://demo.surferseo.com.</p></li>
<li><p>The Administrator informs that the free Account allows one to utilise all available factors. The Administrator reserves the right to make changes to the availability of individual factors in free Accounts at any moment.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyses are carried out in real time, require several minutes to process, and cover anywhere between several and several hundred factors.</p></li>
<li><p>The Administrator reserves the right to present analysis results carried out not in real time, containing information not older than three months.</p></li>
<li><p>Via the Account the User also has access to results of previous Queries from previous three months.</p></li>
<li><p>The Administrator informs that the analysis and the results are presented only for information purposes and the Website is designed for professionals, able to properly utilise them. The analyses are not meant to serve as clues or recommendations, and undertaking any actions on the basis of received results is completely voluntary. The Administrator is therefore not liable for the means of usage of the data acquired via the Website and any results stemming therefrom.</p></li>
<li><p>If a Customer forgets / loses the password that they provided during registration, they have an option to use the &quot;Remind Password&quot; functionality, which will generate and send an e-mail to the e-mail address that was provided during registration with a link enabling one to reset the password.</p></li>
</ol>

<h5>§5. PAYMENT</h5>

<ol>
<li><p>Creating an Account on the Website carries no financial obligations.</p></li>
<li><p>With the free Account a User may place up to 5 Queries every day. Unused Queries are not cumulative.</p></li>
<li><p>Placing any additional Queries and access to analysis of factors unavailable in free Accounts requires one to purchase a subscription. Subscription costs 399 USD annually and allows users to make up to 50 Queries every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Payments may only be issued online via credit cards, requiring the User to submit their card&#39;s number, expiry date and CVC code.</p></li>
<li><p>At an express request of the User, sent via e-mail to support@surferseo.com, the Administrator may issue a pro-forma invoice and allow the User to issue the payment by other means.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the subscription expires, the User shall retain access to Queries results from the previous three months, but loses access to factors that are unavailable in free Accounts.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>If the User feels that the Administrator is not providing their services in accordance with the previously established rules, they may file a formal complaint.
